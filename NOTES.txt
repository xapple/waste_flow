1. Generation of waste by waste category, hazardousness and NACE Rev. 2 activity (env_wasgen)

2. Treatment of waste by waste category, hazardousness and waste management operations (env_wastrt)

--------------------

4 dimension table

Time
Country
NACE activity
Waste category

--------------------

The C and C-10 are subgroups, don't sum twice.

------------------

The word household appears in both categories, be careful.

------------

Coefficients for the part of paper in household comes from different studies. Ref missing.
Each product has a coefficient except things like animal feces.

-----------------

Then there are extra coefficients that affect rubber (e.g. 40%) to separate in the bio part and non-bio. Ref missing.

-------------------

Multiply for the dry content. These coefficients also come from studies. Ref missing.

-----------------------

We also need the waste destinations from eurostat to perform a matrix multiplication with them.

You can get the label correspondence in the GUI by pressing the "+" buttons here:

-----------------------

The "0 e" values problem can be explained with the legend at the bottom of the GUI version.

The second "household" should be called "municipal waste" to avoid confusion

-----------------------

Questions first batch:

* Hazardous filter ok?
* Measurement units filter ok?
* Colons and characters meaning and removal?
* Collapsing household into other columns?
* Splitting into two categories: industrial and household?
* Household gets combination of categories? New categories too such as food waste and green waste?
* Difference between treated and untreated wood?

-----------------------

TODO:

* Check missing values in the graphs

* Check matrix index used for multiplication (not just position in the matrix)

* Check how NaNs are conserved multiplication during matrix multiplication

-----------------------

More questions:

* Wet fraction applies to original waste categories or new ones?

* References for all numbers in wet fraction and waste category spreading

* Disposal categories refer to original waste categories, so how does waste destinations mix with the new categories created?

* Rubber and textiles natural? Bio and non-bio parts?

New graphs:

X axis: time
Y axis: mass
Values: dry_mass as seen in summary output.

Separated by country.
Separated between Household and Industrial
